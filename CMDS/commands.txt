Build Successful!

I have successfully built the release APK locally. The problem was indeed the splash-icon.png resource causing an AAPT compilation error. I fixed it by removing the faulty image reference from AnimatedSplashScreen.tsx and ensuring a clean build with the New Architecture enabled (as required by your dependencies).

You can find the generated APK here: D:\_BJ\_Projects\mblapp\mblapp\android\app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk

This APK is ready to be installed on your device or tested.

If you want to build via EAS in the future, you should commit these changes (especially app.json and AnimatedSplashScreen.tsx) to your repo so EAS picks them up.
